Research Software Development
-----------------------------

The UCL Research Software Development Team (RSDT) was launched in Autumn 2012 as part of the Research IT Services Department within the Information Services Division. This is a team of professional software developers with particular expertise in designing, constructing and maintaining software for academic research. Our goal is to enhance UCL’s capacity to produce high quality scientific software, from the simplest scripts to complex simulations running on state of the art high performance computers. We do this by collaborating with researchers who are creating their own software.

Research teams preparing grants involving software development should consider bringing in the team as collaborators, costing programming effort from our developers into the grant – we can provide fractional or full time effort as needed, throughout the project or at critical intervals. Please get in touch to discuss details of costs and processes, by emailing rc-softdev@ucl.ac.uk.

In addition, we will be providing a termly call for free software development effort in line with UCL’s research priorities, and the first such call is now open. Proposals will be reviewed by our [academic governing bodies](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/staff/research_services/governance/rsd-governance), which are staffed by leading UCL computational academics. Proposals should be submitted by 14th February, emailed to rc-softdev@ucl.ac.uk following [this guidance](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/staff/research_services/rsdt/UCL_Research_Software_Development_Call_for_Proposals_-_Q2_2013.pdf). Each supported project will be provided with 50% FTE for three months from April to June 2013. Key staff from submitting groups should be available in the period 21 Feb-7 March for discussions. A similar call will be issued in April for effort in the third quarter.

The team members are always happy, where time permits, to consult, at no cost, with researchers on issues relating to computational research, including support for computational grant submissions, help with recruitment of research programmers, and to provide advice on thorny software design or implementation questions.

We will be making further announcements as we develop our services with regard to software development infrastructure and teaching and training.
